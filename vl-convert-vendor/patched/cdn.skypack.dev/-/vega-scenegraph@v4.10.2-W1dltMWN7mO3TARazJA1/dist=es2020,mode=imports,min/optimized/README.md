`vega-scenegraph.js` is the unminified version of vega-scenegraph 4.10.2 from https://cdn.skypack.dev/-/vega-scenegraph@v4.10.2-W1dltMWN7mO3TARazJA1/dist=es2020,mode=imports/optimized/vega-scenegraph.js with the following changes:
 - The text width patch from https://github.com/vega/vega/pull/3792 is applied
 - The import URLs have had ",min" added so that they refer to the minified versions that we vendor

Future releases of vega-scenegraph will include this fix
